    <h4 class="time-period period-2015">December 2015</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><h2><b>Created this website.</b></h2>Found out that Github hosted free static webpages and decided to create one so I could have a place to put up all the things I have worked on and that I am working on.
            It also encourages me to get more done because other people can now see what I'm doing and it's a great place for me to practice my HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
            This website is essentially my portfolio. I can mention things here that I wouldn't normally put on my CV (what employer cares that you did 10 tutorials in whatever topic?).
            I can also eventually use this web page for simple games and other visualisations.
            A game displayed here would effectively combine all 3 of my main specialisations above
            e.g. if the game contains <span style="color: green;">AI</span>, <span style="color: orangered;">graphics</span> and of course <span style="color: cadetblue;">Web technologies</span> to display it here.</li>
        <!-- TODO MYSQL DATABASE PROJECT ENTITY RELATIONSHIP, FUNCTIONAL DEPENDANCY, CONSTRAINTS, TRIGGERS, SECURITY.-->
        <!-- TODO FINAL COMPUTER VISION ASSIGNment. abandoned and removed objects-->
        <!-- VIDEO UNDERSTANDING KEY FRAMES, SCENE CLASSIFICATION, ETC-->
        <!-- TODO MOBILE COMMS? NAH-->
        <li>Finished a 3D tank game I made for my 4th year College Computer Graphics module using OpenGL and C++. Some other libraries I used were SOIL for textures, FreeType for text rendering, glm for maths and Assimp for model importing.

         I wanted to add much more features in the end like AI (boids), better texture mapping, better level generation, better collision, normal mapping etc. But in the end I ran out of time and it was only worth 10% of the module so I was almost getting full marks anyway.

        The list of things I implemented:
            <ul>
        <li>Lighting (point lights, directional lights and spot lights).</li>
        <li>Simple AI.</li>
        <li>Stealth mode for the player tank. Alpha blending is used to show that stealth mode is activated and the enemy tanks can't see you.</li>
        <li>Hierarchical models. The tank wheels and the tank turret.</li>
        <li>Texture mapping for the level.</li>
        <li>Models I created in Blender. The tank, the level and the bullets.</li>
        <li>Text rendering.</li>
        <li>Collision detection.</li>
        <li>Particles for both the tank's boosters and enemy explosions.</li>
        <li>A few more small things.</li>
        </ul></li>

            <ul>
                <li>Computer Graphics. 3D objects, transformations, textures, camera views, matrices, lighting etc. Got a nice head start on this one from all my gaming side projects.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Completed 2 years of general engineering in TCD. Which was just bridges and other stuff with only 1 programming module per year.<br>
            I was taught the basics of C++ in my 'Computer Engineering I' module in 1st year (variables, loops, functions etc). <br>
            I was taught more advanced C++ in my 'Computer Engineering II' module in 2nd year (OOP, Pointers, Inheritance, Polymorphism, memory allocation, simple data structures, a bit of multithreading etc). <br>
            <p>I never thought I was too good at programming from seeing many others around me easily solve problems which was discouraging.
                However somewhere near the start of the programming module in 2nd year I decided that I'd actually try to give it a shot and see if it was possible to get good at programming.
                So I worked at it, asked hundreds of questions to my Dad (who is a programmer) and slaved away and eventually an amazing thing happened. I got good at it (surprise surprise) and even started to enjoy it.
                I made sure to do well in every lab assignment and got 100% in the big programming project which involved bank information and multi-threading.</p>

            <p>And from then on I was happy to do programming for the rest of my life. Nothing beats the feeling of solving a problem. Dopamine being released is what people get addicted to (that warm fuzzy feeling).
                Some people call this the Eureka effect, my maths teacher in school called it 'The Buzz'. I call it 'The God Feeling'. <br>
                Doesn't matter what you call it though, it's real.
                And it's sad most people in the world feel it only a few times a year when they could be feeling it daily.
                It beats any other drug because it's free, the effect lasts longer, it actually improves your life, grows your brain, makes you happier and many other reasons. <br>
                The bigger the problem, the bigger the buzz.</p>

            <p>
                The Buzz can be achieved from many disciplines, however I personally find programming is one of the easiest ones to get high from, as all it takes is a few keystrokes (or a few million keystrokes) and you've solved a problem.
                And there are literally trillions of problems in programming. From the high level problems (Create game in C++, create neural network to recognize handwritten digits etc)
                to middle level problems (create function to calculate the volume of a planet) to lower level problems (add two variables together, put semicolon in right place). <br>
                Programming is also great because you have to keep improving to keep up with the fast pace of technology. My attitude is that anything I learn today will help me tomorrow, let alone a week, a month or 10 years from now.
                This applies even if the topics are totally different e.g. Embedded Assembly vs Neural Networks with Python. This is because one can become better at learning itself.
