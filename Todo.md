5. Web html/css tests or just cool things.
6. 12 boxes per year. Massive calendar showing what I achieved each month. Or just monthly blog. Only show 1-3 months per page scroll with focus on current month. Pictures (keep gallery separate but only in calender will they automatically go to gallery wait no need for auto) , achievements, projects.
Give user option to change colors or style of everything. User system that remembers style and gets monthly-3months updates. Damn security. Problem solved with no passwords. Tell user no password no need for security.
