<!--TODO POINTLESS ONLY SHOWING MY SUCCESSES (i DONT WANT people thinking im just perfect at everything and super productive) Productivity is a constant struggle for me and
    college I generally dont do well in because I'm lazy when it comes to it. SO I'LL BE HONEST. I FAILED CHEMISTRY, SIGNALS AND SYSTEMS digital circuits and just barely passed 2nd year.
    Alot of my assignments are late and a lot of the time i only start studying for an exam the night before. I set goals 10-20 goals weekly and on average only get half of them done. I have never gotten all my goals done,
    However when the day comes that I learn to be even more productive and finish all my goals I will be truly dangerous. Anywhere these are my failures (we aren't all perfect). Now here are my success stories.-->

    <!-- TODO FIND MORE THINGS I DID SUMMER 2014? EULER PROBLEMS? -->

    <!-- TODO mention about music about my 2nd passion and struggles with doing engineering vs music.-->

    <!-- TODO <p>I'm also very interested in music and have been playing and doing grades in Classical Guitar for 15 years now. I also play electric guitar and piano and have been in a few bands.</p> -->

    <!-- TODO I LEFT SCHOOL wanting to do music and had a major dilemma in my life but now im happy i did what my parents wanted me to do.-->

Pictures (keep gallery separate but only in calender will they automatically go to gallery wait no need for auto) , achievements, projects.
