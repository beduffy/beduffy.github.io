What I aim for this github static website to be:
1. A blog I can write what I have done monthly or yearly in.
2. A gallery of images of things I have created.
3. Hopefully can show a few visualisations and maybe even a game using Phaser or WebGL.
4. Much more if Github is fast enough and allows me enough space (limit is 1GB so that should be enough).
