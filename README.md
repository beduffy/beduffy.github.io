<h5>What I aim for this static website to be:</h5>
<ol>
<li>A blog I can write what I have done monthly.
<li>A gallery of images and videos of things I have created. Essentially a portfolio</li>
<li>Hopefully I can show a few visualisations and games using Phaser or WebGL.</li>
<li>Much more if Github is fast enough and allows me enough space (limit is 1GB so that should be enough).</li>
<ol>
